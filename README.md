## Tools
### Morphological Operations

The Morphological Operations GUI is a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of applying various morphological operations to images using the OpenCV library. It offers an intuitive way to experiment with different operations and their parameters, providing a real-time preview of the resulting image. 

- **Supported Operations**: The tool supports a wide range of morphological operations, including:
  - Erosion: Shrinks the foreground objects and removes small noise.
  - Dilation: Expands the foreground objects and fills small holes.
  - Opening: Performs erosion followed by dilation, useful for removing small objects and noise.
  - Closing: Performs dilation followed by erosion, useful for closing small holes and gaps.

### Image Annotation

Enables manual labeling of regions of interest (ROI) within images. It provides a user-friendly interface to crop ROI patches, assign labels by pressing corresponding keys, and save the annotated crops into organized folders for further analysis or training.
